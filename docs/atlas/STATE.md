# Atlas — Current State

This document reflects VERIFIED current state as of the commit below. It
changes often — keep it short and current, not a historical changelog
(see ARCHITECTURE.md/PRODUCT.md for durable structure/decisions).

**HEAD commit:** `d665b5c`

## Completed

- Vercel/GitHub deployment connection working.
- Hero visual v1 approved and frozen.
- Suat Kılıç brand identity integrated (no "Atlas AI" badge on
  client-facing visuals).
- Live research foundation: TCMB + TKGM adapters, 30-day freshness
  cutoff, topic-family diversification, recurring-series suppression.
- "Current Content Opportunities" dashboard — first user-facing live
  research workflow (find → select → generate content → generate visual
  → draft saved for approval).
- Explicit approval → publish safety chain preserved throughout (Instagram
  live via Meta; nothing auto-publishes).
- **CAROUSEL V1 = FROZEN** (final validation task, no code changes
  required — validation-only was the successful outcome). Frozen scope:
  `src/lib/ai/image/templates/carousel.ts` (5-slide renderer),
  `src/lib/ai/image/resvg-renderer.ts`'s `buildPannedCoverImageMarkup`
  (pan/zoom compositing), and the carousel branch of
  `src/app/api/generate-visual/route.ts`. Exactly 5 separate 1080×1350
  PNGs in fixed order (cover → what happened → why it matters →
  considerations → CTA/closing), one paid image-generation call reused
  across slides 1-4 via deterministic pan/zoom crops (max 1.2x zoom,
  clamped anchors), slide 5 a photo-free branded closing card. Validated
  by: the existing 22-test `tests/carousel.test.mjs` suite (including a
  real, non-mocked resvg-wasm render producing 5 genuine PNG buffers at
  the exact target dimensions) plus a fresh real render of all 5 slides
  through the actual production pipeline using the same long-Turkish
  stress-copy fixture the test suite already uses — visually inspected,
  zero clipping/overflow, brand mark and progress indicator pixel-
  consistent across all 5 slides, slide 5 intentionally distinct
  (solid navy + gold accent, no photo). Persistence confirmed by code
  review: slide 1 → `final_image_url` (thumbnail), all 5 URLs → the
  existing `metadata.carouselImages` jsonb column, no schema migration.
  Single Image path confirmed unaffected (separate branch in the same
  route, no shared code beyond `shared.ts`/`brand.ts`/
  `resvg-renderer.ts`'s common primitives, which Hero v1 also already
  depends on unmodified). Approval/publishing untouched — the carousel
  insert never sets `status`, no publish call exists anywhere in this
  path, and the dashboard preview explicitly tells the user the result
  is a draft pending approval. **Must not be reopened casually — only a
  real, reproduced production regression justifies revisiting this.**
  Next roadmap item: **live domain + responsive mobile/PWA usage.**

## Current known issues / limitations

- Research source diversity: 4 live adapters now (TCMB, TKGM, Resmî
  Gazete, ÇŞİDB — Resmî Gazete's TLS blocker was fixed and it's
  registered; ÇŞİDB is new) — see ARCHITECTURE.md section B. TÜİK, BDDK,
  and Sarıyer Belediyesi remain unintegrated (no reliable per-item
  date/structure available). Real-world per-run opportunity count still
  varies with what these official sources actually published recently —
  quality/freshness rules mean a quiet period honestly returns fewer
  opportunities, not padded ones.
- A separate, uncommitted "Current Topic Discovery v1" AI web-search
  discovery layer (`aiDiscovery.ts`/`grounding.ts`) exists in the working
  tree but is intentionally NOT merged into this state or frozen yet —
  live-tested and functionally working, but paused pending a cost/
  provider decision (see that task's own report). Not part of this
  Carousel freeze; do not conflate the two.
- 4 known pre-existing, unrelated test failures (confirmed non-regressing
  across the last several tasks — do not "fix" without investigating
  first, they're stale test mocks, not application bugs):
  - `tests/educational-headline-count.test.mjs` ×2 —
    `parseCanvasDimensions is not a function` (stale mock map).
  - `tests/output-mode.test.mjs` ×2 — `isContentOpportunity is not a
    function` (stale mock map, missing several real imports from an
    earlier refactor).
- Full test suite: 234/238 passing (the 4 above).

## Next work order (intentional — do not reorder without a genuine blocker)

1. Claude Code persistent project memory — COMPLETE.
2. Final Carousel quality validation — COMPLETE.
3. Freeze Carousel V1 — COMPLETE (see above).
4. **Make Atlas usable through a live domain + responsive mobile/PWA — NEXT.**
5. Real usage test.
6. Video / Reels generation.
